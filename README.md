# Fling

Fling is an open source search engine. Fling uses it's very own web crawler to index the web.

We've all had our fair share of search engines and the terror they can be to use. Who knows what Google is doing with all that data! We need to take back the World Wide Web and break free of tailored search results which appeal to you for corporations to make bank.

## Installation

To use the Fling Web Crawler run the webcrawler.php file with the latest version of [php](https://www.php.net/downloads.php).

```bash
php webcrawler.php
```

Ensure you edit your database credentials in the php file.

Fling at this current stage is not live and cannot be used as a replacement search engine. For now, stay tuned. If you can't do this then please, make a pull request with your changes to accelerate the development of Fling.
