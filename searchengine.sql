It taps into the zeitgeist and creates products that entertain, inform and inspire people around the globe through the power of unparalleled storytelling. It promises to ride technological trends that will make its content increasingly realistic and engaging for a growing global audience. It has also created an immersive new environment where its audience can interact with characters and storylines in thrilling new ways, purchase unique items and enjoy the experience with friends and family. What’s more, this company has found a new source of content that’s inexhaustible, evergreen, and universally appealing, and can be developed and produced more efficiently than that of its rivals. Roblox? Think again. The year is 1957, Elvis Presley is dominating the radio waves, Martin Luther King just spoke at the March on Washington – and the company is Walt Disney Productions.In many ways, Roblox which will go public today via direct listing on the NYSE could be considered a 21st-century Disney: a category-defining media company that capitalized on major demographic and technological changes to create totally new forms of entertainment and human interaction. Setting the two side-by-side reveals some interesting parallels. At the time of its IPO, Disney was valued at $32.5 million – approximately $306 million in today’s money. Its eighteenth full-length animated feature (Sleeping Beauty) was in production, and it had just opened Disneyland, an amusement park near Los Angeles. Fast forward half a century: last week, The Walt Disney Company earned five Golden Globes for Pixar’s Soul, Searchlight’s Nomadland, and Hulu’s The United States vs. Billie Holiday. As well as its family of theme parks, it controls several franchises including Pixar, Lucasfilm, Hulu, ESPN and Disney+, and is valued at $358 billion.In many ways, Roblox which will go public today via direct listing on the NYSE, could be considered a 21st-century Disney: a category-defining media company that capitalized on major demographic and technological changes to create totally new forms of entertainment and human interaction.When Dave Baszucki and Eric Cassel started Roblox in 2004, they envisioned a virtual world where people of all ages, from all over the globe, could engage in a variety of collective experiences limited only by their imagination. The pair set off to build a world that could be explored by hundreds of millions of people simultaneously, in their own language, using their preferred device. A teenager on a subway in Seoul could play and chat with other girls in Seattle in a game created by a brilliant 15-year-old developer in Buenos Aires. That bold vision on the verge of science-fiction – a metaverse of rich, user-generated content and real-time co-experience – has not changed to this day. What has changed is that it’s now a reality, the phenomenon that is Roblox: 32.6 million daily users, 8 million creators, billions of hours of engagement every month, and more than 20 million experiences – from running a pizza parlor to escaping a labyrinth, to learning how to scuba dive.I met Dave when we were students together at Stanford in the mid-80s. We were both fans of the movie Mad Max and used to talk about building radically modified vehicles inspired by the movie, racing them, and crashing them. Dave thought that it would be cool to allow kids to build things on a Macintosh and then let the laws of physics act on them as they were dropped from great heights or collided into each other in a realistic simulation. That was the birth of his first product Interactive Physics and the germ of the idea of Roblox.', ''),

They have built a communications platform with a soul, and with a social and community-centric purpose at its core. It gives people a new home to talk, have genuine conversations, and build long-lasting relationships around shared interests and passions.I first met Jason Citron, Discord’s co-founder and CEO, in 2017. It was supposed to be a quick coffee, but he wanted a detailed breakdown of why an e-commerce startup investment I backed had been struggling. That wasn’t really how I’d hoped to impress a founder! But we hit it off, and at dinner with a few of my partners the next night Jason shared Discord’s user engagement metrics. We were all blown away — I’d never seen numbers like that and still haven’t. We moved in record time to get term sheets sorted. Jason, along with CTO and co-founder Stan Vishnevskiy, have both proved to be unusually scalable entrepreneurs who are growing in ambition and capability with the business. The fact that they are both so down to earth makes the relationship even more rewarding.The team never compromised on quality while they were building the site. Discord was something they were building for themselves and for the user community they felt so close to. It’s still an unusually engaged audience; the critical metric here is how many of their 100 million monthly active users use it daily. Only the biggest social media sites can claim a ratio of 50%, but Discord has a truly extraordinary level of engagement.', ''),

This study takes an innovative approach to palaeography—the study of ancient handwriting—as a new entry point to access this scribal culture. One of the problems of palaeography is to determine writer identity or difference when the writing style is near uniform. This is exemplified by the Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaa). To this end, we use pattern recognition and artificial intelligence techniques to innovate the palaeography of the scrolls and to pioneer the microlevel of individual scribes to open access to the Bible’s ancient scribal culture. We report new evidence for a breaking point in the series of columns in this scroll. Without prior assumption of writer identity, based on point clouds of the reduced-dimensionality feature-space, we found that columns from the first and second halves of the manuscript ended up in two distinct zones of such scatter plots, notably for a range of digital palaeography tools, each addressing very different featural aspects of the script samples. In a secondary, independent, analysis, now assuming writer difference and using yet another independent feature method and several different types of statistical testing, a switching point was found in the column series. A clear phase transition is apparent in columns 27–29. We also demonstrated a difference in distance variances such that the variance is higher in the second part of the manuscript. Given the statistically significant differences between the two halves, a tertiary, post-hoc analysis was performed using visual inspection of character heatmaps and of the most discriminative Fraglet sets in the script. Demonstrating that two main scribes, each showing different writing patterns, were responsible for the Great Isaiah Scroll, this study sheds new light on the Bible’s ancient scribal culture by providing new, tangible evidence that ancient biblical texts were not copied by a single scribe only but that multiple scribes, while carefully mirroring another scribe’s writing style, could closely collaborate on one particular manuscript.', 'Artificial intelligence,Charts,Imaging techniques,Digital imaging,Extraction techniques,Quantitative analysis,Forensics,Principal component analysis'),
